          How do I correct my birth certificate in NY?

          <p>
            To correct a birth certificate in New York, you would typically need
            to contact the New York State Department of Health or the New York
            City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, depending on where the
            birth occurred. They can provide you with the necessary forms and
            instructions to request a correction. Please note that you may need
            to provide supporting documentation depending on the type of
            correction requested.

          How long does it take to get vital records in NY?

            The processing time for vital records in New York can vary depending
            on the type of record and the method of request (online, by mail, or
            in person). For example, as of my knowledge cutoff in September
            2021, the New York State Department of Health stated that processing
            times for mail orders were 12-14 weeks. However, online and phone
            orders processed through VitalChek had a processing time of 10-12
            business days. Please check the relevant department's website for
            the most current information.

            Public records in NYC can be accessed through the NYC Department of
            Records and Information Services. They maintain a vast array of
            documents, including vital records, property records, and more. Some
            records can be accessed online, while others may require an
            in-person visit. For specific records, it's best to contact the
            department directly or visit their website for more information.
